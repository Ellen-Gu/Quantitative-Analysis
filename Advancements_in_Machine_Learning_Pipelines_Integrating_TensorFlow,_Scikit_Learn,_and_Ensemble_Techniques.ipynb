        "Recently I read some articles about ML ensembling methods.I think the hands-on book have all the contents of that article well covered. The hand-on book is one of my favorate book, and the chapter of ensembling is well illustrate sklearn's model emsemblings. One of the aspect that most ML books fail to mentioned is finacal viewpoint of model evalutations. That is well explained in another book (illustrating data analysis using both python and R ) which I like most. Almost all the books do not contains real world implementating part. Maybe that is only avaiable in real world, gaining from hands on experiences.\n",

        "To consolidating my learnings, some time has to be spent on codings. Nowdays openai can provide \"building blocks\" to releive some programming works, but people still need to learn programming to better communicate with computers. I have no concerns about the mathematics and computing aspects of ML/DL, but to coding well is another aspect, it needs lots of practice. I spend a well portion of time purely on learing coding itself, and also often \"talk\" with openai, aiming to integrate openai into my toolbox to speed up in ML/DL world. With many new modules/library emerging from time to time, people have to keep learning, and find ways to speed up and extend reachable fields.\n",

        "Fortunately, the data titanic is a data in python module OpenML. So I can happily load it in directly. After fetching data, it is a routine work to do EDA, data cleaning, imputing, feature selection... Those are tons of work before data can be used to modelings. Also, data works shed lights to and shapes what modelings can deliver.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over 80% of time are spent on data work (90%, as to my viewpoint), that is real but have to go through. But here I mainly want to practice on sklearn's pipeline (data pipeline and model pipeline), and also want to test out whether I can bring TensorFlow Neural Network into sklearn's pipelines.\n",

        "Mlflow from databricks is a side aim to be practice on. Somedays' ago I played with H2o (a java based auto ml module/library), calling the API both from R and python interface. The tracking webpage are the same for R and python. It is nice and \"auto\", but the speed is too slow, and the modles in it is limited. In nowdays, people in the field of ML/DL have to quickly adapt to front edge new algorithms. Recently I saw an article saying that algorithm (named \"rope\") from a paper in late last year has already been implemented in major GPT products. The key matrix used in \"rope\" seems a wavelet transformer. The most simply wavelet, corresponding to the \"harr\" functions, is with $\\theta=45°$, while \"rope\" uses a more customized $\\theta$. Signals in brain is transferrred by certain eletric pulse, a single neuron /cell can only perform  a simple task. So I think the transformer which use 2, or $e$, as exponentail base is bio-reasonable. More nerons can then form some groups, layers etc to process complex unstructured information. So generally, more nerons in the layers, more \"groups\" of nerons (like GPU), simple  (linear feeding) task to each nero but complex (non linear) task to groups of neoro (layers), those setttings often can produce better results. On a related note, I once authored a Bash script that proved highly effective. Beyond considering the tree-based structure of the Linux file system, what truly inspired me was nature and life science. Almost every living entity on Earth, from complex organisms to individual cells and even viruses, have a shell/film to separate its inner environment from outside. For complex lifes, cells have membrance, organs have films, and in the most outside, skin or bone/scale alike to make the \"firewall\" to stable each cell groups' functions and better tolerance changes in outside. Doesn't this concept closely resemble that of \"Docker\"?"

Next step is just feed data ($x$) into these $f_i(x)$ to get output ($y$). Sending those classifiers ($f_i(x)$) as parameters to a loop to get output ($y$) from various $f_i(x)$. When X_train and y_train is feed in as input, the $f_i(x)$ is finally well defined, as those constant, parameters in $f_i(x)$ all get its most insightful value from input data. When X_test and y_test is feed to $f_i(x)$, we are using the insights we gained from training data to shed light on those data which are not seen in before by the current model. Here there is an assumption. that is, we suppose the unseen data and the training data are from similar settings. Hence the insight we learn from those training data can be applied to those new unseen data. When this assumption is no longer hold, or somewhat changed after some time period , then we have to collect data to recalibrate or even a complete model rebuild."
